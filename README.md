# innovator1 Hello all I am a complete novice at programming but could do with your help. I require some one that can provide me with "Code" that can provide video images on LED screens.

The project I am working on requires me to provide working video images on a circular led screen. Now I no that cicular screens are available and controllers for them, but I have no Idea of how to make it work. Another part of my project is tthat it is controled via a bluetooth device.

Once again I have no Idea if I can just buy the componants and put it together, or how difficult it would be to make, so if you can provide me with any help it would be much appriciated.
